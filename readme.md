# Sample Markdown File

Welcome to this **sample Markdown file**! Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. 

## Why Use Markdown?

- **Simplicity**: It's very easy to read and write.
- **Flexibility**: Suitable for documentation, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
- **Portability**: Can be easily shared between different devices and operating systems.

## Basic Markdown Syntax

### Headings

Use `#` for a heading level 1, `##` for level 2, and so on.

### Text Formatting

- **Bold**: Wrap text with `**` or `__` (e.g., `**bold text**`)
- *Italic*: Wrap text with `*` or `_` (e.g., `*italic text*`)

- Item 1
